Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the intern position at Nokia, as advertised. Currently pursuing a degree in Mathematics at Waterloo, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to Nokia's dynamic team and gain valuable hands-on experience in developing tools to further data-driven decision making.

Throughout my academic journey, I have honed my skills in data analysis, visualization, and programming, which align perfectly with the requirements of this role. My coursework and prior experience has equipped me with advanced knowledge of MS Office suite and Power BI, and I have practical experience with Python programming. This foundation, combined with my ability to manage multiple projects concurrently, makes me well-prepared to excel as an intern at Nokia.

What excites me most about this internship opportunity is the chance to apply my skills in a real-world setting while contributing to innovative projects that can positively impact Nokia's operations. 

Furthermore, I am enthusiastic about the prospect of engaging with diverse data sources to derive actionable insights that drive business decisions. Nokia's commitment to excellence and innovation resonates with my own values, and I am eager to contribute to the company's success.

Enclosed is my resume, which provides additional details about my academic background and relevant experiences. I am excited about the opportunity to discuss how my skills and enthusiasm align with the goals of the team at Nokia.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of contributing and am available at your earliest convenience for an interview. 

Best regards,
