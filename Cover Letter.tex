Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Fixed Income Summer Intern position at Mackenzie Investments. I am currently pursuing a major in Statistics, Financial Analysis \& Risk Management at the University of Waterloo, with plans to return to my studies in 2025. The combination of my academic background, rigorous quantitative training, and passion for the financial markets makes me a strong candidate to add value to your Fixed Income team this summer.

Through my coursework, I have developed a solid foundation in risk modeling, portfolio analysis, and quantitative methods. My exposure to fixed income securities and their valuation has equipped me with a keen understanding of interest rate dynamics, yield curves, and credit risk assessment. I thrive when translating complex data into actionable insights, and I am well-prepared to support time-sensitive deliverables that require diligent research, critical thinking, and precise execution.

Collaborating on academic and extracurricular projects has also reinforced the importance of effective communication and teamwork. My involvement in various student clubs and group assignments at the University of Waterloo has honed my interpersonal skills, empathy, and adaptability. I am confident in my ability to contribute meaningfully to a dynamic team environment, and I am committed to fostering a culture of mutual respect and trust.

Moreover, my bilingual proficiency in French and English ensures that I can seamlessly support Mackenzie Investments’ diverse clientele and colleagues. By leveraging my language skills, I will be able to collaborate effectively with stakeholders across Canada, including those in Quebec, and provide the highest level of service and responsiveness.

I am inspired by Mackenzie Investments’ reputation for innovation, integrity, and commitment to long-term value creation. The opportunity to work alongside industry professionals this summer would allow me to deepen my expertise, grow as a finance professional, and meaningfully contribute to the firm’s success.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I welcome the chance to discuss how my skills and interests align with Mackenzie Investments’ objectives and the Fixed Income team’s needs. I look forward to the possibility of working together this summer.

Sincerely,

Roy
