Dear Hiring Manager,

I am thrilled to apply for the twelve-month opportunity within the Systematic Strategies Group (SSG) of the Capital Markets and Factor Investing Department. As a third-year statistics student at the University of Waterloo with a strong foundation in quantitative analysis and programming, I am eager to contribute my skills in research, data analysis, and investment strategy development to your dynamic team.

My academic background in statistics has equipped me with robust analytical skills and a solid understanding of empirical research methods. I have gained experience in analyzing large datasets, which I believe will be invaluable in conducting deep-dive analyses of implemented strategies and portfolio performance. Additionally, I have developed strong programming skills in Python, enabling me to design and implement analytical tools and contribute to portfolio construction and risk management frameworks.

I am particularly drawn to the opportunity to collaborate with colleagues in the SSG and the Investment Engineering and Analytics team to research and develop systematic investment strategies across various markets. My interest in capital markets and investment management drives my desire to be part of a team that focuses on innovative strategies, and I am excited about the prospect of presenting my research findings and engaging in discussions that shape investment decisions.

I pride myself on being self-motivated and adaptable, with excellent organizational skills that allow me to manage shifting priorities and new challenges effectively. I am eager to contribute to a high-performance environment that exemplifies integrity and partnership, aligning with CPP Investments' guiding principles.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my skills and passion for systematic investment strategies can contribute to the success of the SSG team.

Sincerely,

Roy
