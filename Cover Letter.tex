Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the Software Engineering Internship at Stripe, as the opportunity to contribute to impactful projects while learning from experienced engineers aligns perfectly with my career aspirations. As a third-year statistics student, I have gained a strong foundation in computer science fundamentals, including data structures, algorithms, and operating systems. My coursework, combined with personal coding projects, has honed my ability to tackle complex problems and deliver clean, well-documented code.

I am particularly drawn to the prospect of working at Stripe due to the innovative work being done in engineering and the emphasis on ownership and collaboration. I am confident that my proficiency in programming languages such as Python along with my passion for developing scalable data solutions, will allow me to make meaningful contributions during the internship.

Outside of academics, I have gained valuable experience through participating in hackathons and working on personal coding projects, where I applied problem-solving skills in real-world scenarios. These experiences have strengthened my technical capabilities and fueled my curiosity to learn more. I am eager to bring this drive to Stripe, where I look forward to growing professionally, collaborating with a diverse team, and contributing to the company's data infrastructure. 

I am excited about the chance to join Stripe for the summer internship, and I am confident that my skills, passion for learning, and strong work ethic will allow me to make a positive impact.

Sincerely,

Roy
